# Reon [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ambassify/reon.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ambassify/reon)

Event library for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

This library acts as a helper dealing with [React's event system](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html) and ensures a flexible interface between components.

## Installation

```
npm install --save reon
```

## Goals

- Remove some boilerplate from code handling events in React.
- Make the interface of an event more flexible by passing an object in as the only argument.

Instead of writing
```js
if (this.props.onUploadReady)
    this.props.onUploadReady(file);
```

you now write
```js
Reon.trigger(this.props.onUploadReady, this, {
    file: file
});
```

## Usage

```
// Trigger new events
Reon.trigger(eventHandler, sourceComponent, [objectContainingData]);

// Forward an event previously received from Reon / React
Reon.forward(eventHandler, sourceComponent, originalEvent, [objectContainingData]);

// Create eventData object with lazy properties
Reon.lazy(properties, [objectToAttachTo]);
```

The `eventHandler` will receive an object as its first argument which contains all of the properties of `objectContainingData` and optionally the properties `reonEvent`, `reactEvent` and `nativeEvent` when using `Reon.forward`.

- `reonEvent` is added when the forwarded event is an event generated by Reon.
- `reactEvent` is added when the forwarded event is either a [React Synthetic Event](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#syntheticevent) or a event generated by Reon. It will point to the original React event that was forwarded.
- `nativeEvent` is added whenever `Reon.forward` is used, it will point to the original event that the browser itself generated.

## Examples

### Trigger new events

```js
import Reon from 'reon';

const Button = (props) => (
    <button onClick={e => {
            Reon.trigger(props.onClick, this, { value: props.label });
        }}>
        {props.label}
    </button>
);

const App = (props) => (
    <Button label="foo" onClick={e => {
        console.log(e.value);
    }} />
);
```

### Passing synthetic events to the next component.

```js
import Reon from 'reon';

const Button = (props) => (
    <button onClick={e => {
            Reon.forward(props.onClick, this, e, { value: props.label });
        }}>
        {props.label}
    </button>
);

const App = (props) => (
    <Button label="foo" onClick={e => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        console.log(e.value);
    }} />
);
```

### Creating lazy event properties

```js
import Reon from 'reon';

const Button = (props) => (
    <button onClick={() => {
            Reon.trigger(props.onClick, this, Reon.lazy({
                button: () => this,
                test: () => 'value of test property'
            }));
        }}>
        {props.label}
    </button>
);

const App = (props) => (
    <Button label="foo" onClick={e => {
        console.log(e.button); // prints Button instance
        console.log(e.test); // prints "value of test property"
    }} />
);
```
